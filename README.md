# What's this?!
A higher-effort work-in-progress source-available remake of the [OVERHEAT Game Demo](https://youtu.be/zXXUYTJTVog), done in Unity3D just like the original.
> A first-person shooter and a game jam entry made in ~12 days. Inspired by SUPERHOT and Quake II, it is based around a dynamic slow-motion mechanic that reacts to projectiles flying near the player.
